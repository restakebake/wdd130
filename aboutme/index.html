  <p>Hello everyone. My name is Rebekkah and I am from the United States. I am 31 and have been married to my wonderful
    husband James for just over 13 years. We have 6 crazy kids that range from almost 2 years old to 12 years old.
    I love reading/listening to audiobooks. My free time has been filled up with kids and taking care of 8 puppies that
    our dog had several weeks ago. At the moment we have 4 dogs and 2 cats. </p>
  <p>I have an associates degree in Veterinary Technology and love working with animals. For the past 10 years (wow that makes me sound old) I have been a stay at home mom. God thought I was getting too comfortable
    and so here I am going into Applied Technology. I love learning and can't wait for this semester. </p>

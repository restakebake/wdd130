      <h2>Delta Dog Training</h2>
      <p>Dogs are an important part of our lives. A well trained canine can provide us with unconditional love, companionship, aid in daily 
        tasks and support us emotionally. However, a dog with no training can cause endless damages to our homes and make it impossible for 
        us to enjoy having them in our lives. I am here to help. I want to see the relationships between man and man's best friend be a positive,
        and rewarding experience. If you are bring home a brand new puppy, I am here. If you have a dog that just needs basic manners, I am here.
        Come join me in my group lessons or if you are wanting a more personal experience, I also have private inhome lessons available as well.</p>

      <p>
        Dogs are an important part of our lives. A well trained canine can provide us with unconditional love, companionship, aid in daily 
        tasks and support us emotionally. However, a dog with no training can cause endless damages to our homes and make it impossible for 
        us to enjoy having them in our lives. I am here to help. I want to see the relationships between man and man's best friend be a positive,
        and rewarding experience. If you are bring home a brand new puppy, I am here. If you have a dog that just needs basic manners, I am here.
        Come join me in my group lessons or if you are wanting a more personal experience, I also have private inhome lessons available as well.

      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        I use the Least Intrusive, Minimally Aversive (LIMA) technique training. LIMA uses the least intrusive, minimally aversive strategy out of a set
        of humane and effective tactics likely to succeed in achieving a training or behavior change objective. LIMA does not justify the use of 
        punishment in lieu of other effective interventions and strategies. In the vast majority of cases, desired behavior change can be affected by focusing 
        on the animalâ€™s environment, physical well-being, and operant and classical interventions such as differential reinforcement of an alternative behavior,
        desensitization, and counter-conditioning.
